  <p>
    Besides these regular meetings, there are several
    activities, either for specific groups, or open to all:
  </p>
  <p>
      Book Club:
      <br/>
      Once a month we read a book and meet to discuss our
      thoughts on it. If you enjoy reading and reviewing books,
      please join us.
  </p>
  <p>
      Creative Writing:
      <br/>
      The Creative Writing Group meets occasionally and also
      functions as an e-group. See the products of our creative
      writers in the Rangoli newsletter.
  </p>
  <p>
      English Conversation:
      <br/>
      This is an informal group, which will give any non-native
      English speaker the opportunity to practice their English.
      You do not have to be fluent in English. It is also an
      opportunity to network and make friends. We usually meet
      once per week directly after Thursday OWC coffee mornings
      and have lunch in a nearby restaurant. We discuss our
      backgrounds and our experiences with living in India, as
      well as abroad. It is an opportunity for people to ask
      questions concerning the English language, yet it is not a
      formal grammar or English teaching session. If you want
      comfortable place to practice English, we would love to
      have you! (This group is currently looking for a
      coordinator)
  </p>
  <p>
      Horse Riding:
      <br/>
      India presents many opportunities to try new things that
      may be cost or time prohibitive back in our home countries.
      Horse riding is one of those activities. If you’re
      interested in pursuing a passion for horse riding, please
      join us. The instructors are excellent, offering classes
      for everyone from absolute beginners to advanced riders.
      For children, there is also a popular Pony Club that runs
      “Own a Pony” days and “Kids Kamp” weekends.
  </p>
  <p>
      Lunch Bunch:
      <br/>
      Each month club members have lunch together at an area
      restaurant, discovering new hotspots and old Bangalore
      secrets. Cuisines have ranged from regional Indian and
      Japanese to Mediterranean and more. Join us as we taste our
      way around Bangalore. Second Thursday of the month.
  </p>
  <p>
      Bumps and Babies:
      <br/>
      This group was created to help and support women who are
      pregnant for the first time and moms who are expecting
      again. This group is here to provide you with information
      you may need or for answers you may be looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
      Playgroups:
      <br/>
      Playgroups meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the homes of
      OWC members. If you have babies or pre-school children and
      want to meet up with others in a similar situation, this is
      an ideal opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
      Road Trip:
      <br/>
      If you would like to explore interesting places in and
      around the city, this is a great activity for you. Every
      month we visit a different venue to see what it has to
      offer and learn a little more about our city. Previous
      trips have included specialty shops, spas, hospitals,
      ashrams, and more. Third Wednesday of the month.
  </p>
  <p>
      Sundowners:
      <br/>
      This activity provides an excellent opportunity to relax
      and meet new people. OWC members and their partners gather
      twice a month for cocktails, light snacks, and/or dinner.
      Join us to unwind and socialize at the end of the week (and
      avail special OWC discounts on food and beverages). Last
      Friday of the month.
  </p>
  <p>
      Professional Women's Group:
      <br/>
      We meet monthly during evening hours to accommodate those
      members who may not be able to attend OWC gatherings due to
      their work schedules. This is a great place to network and
      reconnect with other professionals if you are temporarily
      out of the working world due to your Bangalore move.

    <h1>Accomodations</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Temporary Accomodation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>When you first arrive in Bangalore, you may need temporary
    accommodation, particularly if you are still waiting for
    your shipment to arrive. Hotels and serviced apartments are
    available; however, hotels can prove to be the more
    expensive option as they struggle to keep up with demand.
    Serviced apartments are often preferable, particularly if
    you are travelling with small children or if you anticipate
    a lengthy stay in temporary accommodation. These come
    furnished and with basic appliances. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Long-term Accommodation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There is a wide range of good quality expatriate rental
    accommodations available in Bangalore. This ranges from
    independent houses to semi-detached homes, gated compounds,
    condominiums, and apartments. Both furnished and
    unfurnished homes are available.
    </p>
    <p>There is no shortage of real estate companies in the city.
    Once the lease agreement has been signed, the agent
    collects a fee (usually one month’s rent) from both you and
    from the landlord. The lease agreement is usually for 11
    months, which is renewable at the beginning of the 12th
    month, though the lease period will be for 2 to 3 years.
    When terminating the lease, a period of 2 months notice is
    required.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Utilities</h2>
    <br>
    <p>For both houses and for apartments, the payment of utility
    charges is the responsibility of the tenant.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Electricity</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The electric current is 220V AC, 50 cycles; and the
    Euro(Continental) and Schuko plug is used. Every
    house/apartment is allocated a certain amount of power, and
    this often needs to be shed to prevent overloading the
    system and the subsequent blowing of fuses. The landlord
    may apply for additional power, but this is not always
    granted. The purchasing of a surge protector, a UPS for
    your computer, an emergency lamp, and some candles will
    help to minimise the inconvenience of living with
    fluctuating electricity levels.
    </p>
    </p>For U.S. expats, it is a good idea to buy some transformers
    before leaving home if you intend to bring US appliances
    with you. Check your appliances for a 110V to 250V rating,
    as some appliances and cords are now being manufactured to
    run on both voltages, needing only a plug adapter to
    operate in other countries. Most appliances are now
    available locally; but some are in short supply, can be
    expensive, and cannot be used back in the States.
    <p>
    <br>
    <h2>Water</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The supply of water in Bangalore is fairly reliable;
    however, rooftop reservoir tanks can ensure a better
    supply. For the safety of you and your family, it is
    advisable to install a water filter/purifier system in your
    home. They can be purchased at any larger appliance store
    in Bangalore. Hot water is rarely provided in the kitchen
    so hot water geysers for the kitchen and bathrooms may need
    to be requested from the landlord prior to you taking up
    occupancy.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Telephones</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Before you move into your home, make sure that you have a
    telephone line, as applying for one is often a very lengthy
    process. If however, you do not have one, apply to the
    Karnataka Telecommunications Department. Your landlord
    should be able to assist you with this.
    </p>
    <p>Mobile phone providers are plentiful, and setting up a
    phone account is a straightforward process.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Cooking Gas</h2>
    <br>
    <p>A cooking gas connection should already be in place in your
    home. The connection comes with 2 gas cylinders. If you do
    not have one, speak to your landlord about procuring a
    connection.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Noise</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Bangalore is a noisy city, so to ensure a good night’s
    sleep, check the location of mosques, temples, shops, and
    convention halls before making a decision on a property.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Furniture and Furnishings</h2>
    <br>
    <p>If you are bringing your furniture and paintings here to
    Bangalore, you should consider the climate. It is hot,
    humid, and very dusty. Many rented homes do not provide
    window treatments, but a wide variety of fabrics and
    ready-made treatments are available in several sizes. It is
    very easy to have custom window treatments made at a
    reasonable price.
